 This is an implementation demo  of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between source and destination nodes of a graph
How to use: 1- This project is compatible with C99 standard. This is a console application.
            2- You can use code::blocks IDE to open the project file. However you are free to use your own building procedure.
            3- Directly open the main.c and define nodes and edges plus start and end nodes. then run the program.
